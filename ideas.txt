You can think of CRUD Applications as middlemen between a user and the database.

The user is going to be looking at some HTML, and they'd like to "do something".  That thing is either create something new, or view something (GET, POST).
We'd like to create pages that let them move around the application in a natural fashion.  A given resources index page (for example houses) is a place where they can see all the items in a given table in the database.  However, just showing the houses is useless, there's no way for the user to move to another part of the application or tell the server to do something.  We need to construct intelligent links that allow the user to go somewhere or do something.  The URL's we construct should follow restful conventions and both show how resources are related and capture information about the specific ids of the resources we want to change or view.  If we want to allow the user to change something, we'll construct a form that they can post to our server so we know to alter the database.  If we just want them to be able to view something in the database we construct links that will request the right things from the database.
